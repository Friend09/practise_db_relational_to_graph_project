### üöÄ **Once All Tests Pass**

You're ready to run the full project:

```bash
cd scripts
python generate_data.py      # Creates sample data
python create_db.py          # Sets up SQLite database
python migrate_to_neo4j.py   # Migrates data to Neo4j
python neo4j_queries.py      # Runs graph analysis
```

## Quick Start Guide

**Before running the project steps, make sure Neo4j is set up and running!**

### Step 0: Verify Setup

First, validate your setup by running:

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Python Packages: PASS
- ‚úÖ Project Structure: PASS
- ‚úÖ SQLite Functionality: PASS
- ‚ùå Neo4j Connection: FAIL (if Neo4j not started yet)

If Neo4j connection fails, complete the Neo4j setup in Section 3 above, then run the test again.

### Step 1: Generate Sample Data

```bash
cd scripts
python generate_data.py
```

This creates `data/applications.csv` with 100 sample application records.

### Step 2: Create SQLite Database

```bash
python create_db.py
```

This creates `data/applications.db` and loads the sample data.

### Step 3: Explore Relational Data

```bash
python explore_db.py
```

This provides insights into the relational data structure and relationships.

### Step 4: Migrate to Neo4j

```bash
# Make sure Neo4j is running first
python migrate_to_neo4j.py
```

This converts the relational data into a graph database.

### Step 5: Analyze Graph Data

```bash
python neo4j_queries.py
```

This runs comprehensive analysis queries on the graph database.

## Key Features

### Relational Database Schema

The applications table includes fields designed to demonstrate relationships:

- **Basic Info**: name, description, version, cost
- **Categorization**: category, subcategory for grouping
- **Vendor Relationships**: vendor information for supplier analysis
- **Ownership**: department, owners, leads for organizational structure
- **Dependencies**: comma-separated lists of dependent applications
- **Integrations**: applications that integrate with this one
- **Compliance**: requirements and security classifications

### Graph Database Model

The graph model creates the following node types:

- **Application**: Core application entities
- **Category**: Application categories and subcategories
- **Vendor**: Software suppliers
- **Department**: Organizational departments
- **Person**: Application owners and leads
- **ExternalApp**: External applications for dependencies/integrations

### Relationship Types

- **BELONGS_TO**: Application ‚Üí Category
- **SUPPLIED_BY**: Application ‚Üí Vendor
- **OWNED_BY**: Application ‚Üí Department
- **OWNS/LEADS/MANAGES**: Person ‚Üí Application
- **DEPENDS_ON**: Application ‚Üí ExternalApp
- **INTEGRATES_WITH**: Application ‚Üí ExternalApp

## Example Analyses

### 1. Vendor Consolidation Analysis

Find vendors supplying multiple applications to identify consolidation opportunities:

```cypher
MATCH (v:Vendor)<-[:SUPPLIED_BY]-(a:Application)
RETURN v.name, count(a) as app_count, sum(a.annual_cost) as total_cost
ORDER BY app_count DESC
```

### 2. Dependency Risk Assessment

Identify shared dependencies that could be single points of failure:

```cypher
MATCH (a:Application)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(e:ExternalApp)<-[:DEPENDS_ON]-(other:Application)
WHERE a <> other
RETURN e.name as shared_dependency, count(DISTINCT a) as risk_level
ORDER BY risk_level DESC
```

### 3. Department Portfolio Analysis

Analyze application portfolios by department:

```cypher
MATCH (d:Department)<-[:OWNED_BY]-(a:Application)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Category)
RETURN d.name, c.name, count(a) as app_count
ORDER BY d.name, app_count DESC
```
