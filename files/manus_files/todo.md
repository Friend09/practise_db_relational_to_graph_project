## Phase 1: Design and create the applications table schema

- [x] Define the schema for the 'applications' table, including fields for relationships.
- [x] Create the `applications.sql` file with the table creation DDL.

## Phase 2: Generate sample data and create SQL database

- [x] Generate realistic sample data for the `applications` table and save it as `applications.csv`.
- [x] Create a SQLite database (`applications.db`).
- [x] Load the `applications.sql` schema into the SQLite database.
- [x] Import the `applications.csv` data into the `applications` table in the SQLite database.

## Phase 3: Develop Python code for database creation and data loading

- [x] Create Python script to generate sample data (`generate_data.py`).
- [x] Create Python script to create SQLite database and load data (`create_db.py`).
- [x] Create a Python script to query and explore the relational database.
- [x] Test the database creation and data loading scripts.

## Phase 4: Create Neo4j migration and graph modeling code

- [x] Install Neo4j Python driver.
- [x] Create Python script to migrate data from SQLite to Neo4j.
- [x] Design the graph model (nodes and relationships).
- [x] Implement the migration logic to create nodes and relationships.
- [x] Test the migration script.

## Phase 5: Develop Neo4j queries and analysis examples

- [x] Create a collection of Cypher queries for different analysis scenarios.
- [x] Create Python script to demonstrate graph analysis.
- [x] Document the insights that can be gained from the graph database.
- [x] Create examples showing the difference between relational and graph queries.

## Phase 6: Create documentation and insights analysis

- [x] Create comprehensive README.md for the project.
- [x] Create setup and installation instructions.
- [x] Document key insights and learnings from the graph database approach.
- [x] Create a tutorial guide for users to follow.

## Phase 7: Package and deliver the complete project

- [x] Create a project summary and overview.
- [x] Package all files and ensure project structure is complete.
- [x] Create a final deliverable package for the user.
- [x] Provide final recommendations and next steps.
