# Relational vs Graph Database: Query Comparison

This document demonstrates the differences between querying relational data using SQL and graph data using Cypher, highlighting the advantages of graph databases for relationship-heavy analysis.

## Scenario 1: Finding Applications by Vendor

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
SELECT app_name, vendor_name, annual_cost
FROM applications
WHERE vendor_name = 'Microsoft'
ORDER BY annual_cost DESC;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
MATCH (v:Vendor {name: 'Microsoft'})<-[:SUPPLIED_BY]-(a:Application)
RETURN a.name, v.name, a.annual_cost
ORDER BY a.annual_cost DESC
```

**Analysis:** Both approaches are similar for simple lookups, but the graph approach makes the relationship explicit.

## Scenario 2: Finding Shared Dependencies

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
-- Complex SQL with string parsing and multiple joins
WITH app_dependencies AS (
    SELECT app_name, 
           TRIM(value) as dependency
    FROM applications
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(depends_on_apps, ',')
    WHERE depends_on_apps IS NOT NULL AND depends_on_apps != ''
),
shared_deps AS (
    SELECT dependency, COUNT(*) as app_count
    FROM app_dependencies
    GROUP BY dependency
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT sd.dependency, sd.app_count,
       STRING_AGG(ad.app_name, ', ') as dependent_apps
FROM shared_deps sd
JOIN app_dependencies ad ON sd.dependency = ad.dependency
GROUP BY sd.dependency, sd.app_count
ORDER BY sd.app_count DESC;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
MATCH (a:Application)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(e:ExternalApp)<-[:DEPENDS_ON]-(other:Application)
WHERE a <> other
RETURN e.name as shared_dependency, 
       collect(DISTINCT a.name) as dependent_apps,
       count(DISTINCT a) as app_count
ORDER BY app_count DESC
```

**Analysis:** The graph approach is much more intuitive and readable. The relationship traversal is natural, while SQL requires complex string parsing and aggregation.

## Scenario 3: Finding Applications 2 Degrees Away

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
-- Very complex SQL with multiple self-joins and string parsing
WITH RECURSIVE dependency_chain AS (
    -- Base case: direct dependencies
    SELECT a1.app_name as source_app,
           TRIM(dep.value) as intermediate_app,
           a2.app_name as target_app,
           1 as depth
    FROM applications a1
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(a1.depends_on_apps, ',') dep
    JOIN applications a2 ON TRIM(dep.value) = a2.app_name
    WHERE a1.depends_on_apps IS NOT NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: 2-degree dependencies
    SELECT dc.source_app,
           dc.target_app as intermediate_app,
           TRIM(dep2.value) as target_app,
           dc.depth + 1
    FROM dependency_chain dc
    JOIN applications a ON dc.target_app = a.app_name
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(a.depends_on_apps, ',') dep2
    WHERE dc.depth < 2 AND a.depends_on_apps IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT source_app, target_app, depth
FROM dependency_chain
WHERE depth = 2;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
MATCH (a:Application)-[:DEPENDS_ON*2]->(target:ExternalApp)
RETURN a.name as source_app, target.name as target_app
```

**Analysis:** The graph approach is dramatically simpler. What requires complex recursive SQL with multiple joins becomes a simple path expression in Cypher.

## Scenario 4: Finding Vendor-Department Relationships

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
SELECT vendor_name, department, COUNT(*) as app_count,
       SUM(annual_cost) as total_cost
FROM applications
WHERE vendor_name IS NOT NULL AND department IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY vendor_name, department
ORDER BY app_count DESC;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
MATCH (v:Vendor)<-[:SUPPLIED_BY]-(a:Application)-[:OWNED_BY]->(d:Department)
RETURN v.name as vendor, d.name as department, 
       count(a) as app_count, sum(a.annual_cost) as total_cost
ORDER BY app_count DESC
```

**Analysis:** Both approaches work well for this scenario, but the graph approach makes the relationships more explicit and readable.

## Scenario 5: Impact Analysis - What Happens if We Remove an Application?

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
-- Find applications that depend on 'Gmail'
WITH dependent_apps AS (
    SELECT app_name
    FROM applications
    WHERE depends_on_apps LIKE '%Gmail%'
       OR integrates_with_apps LIKE '%Gmail%'
),
-- Find applications in the same category (potential alternatives)
alternatives AS (
    SELECT app_name, category
    FROM applications a1
    WHERE category IN (
        SELECT category 
        FROM applications 
        WHERE app_name = 'Gmail'
    )
    AND app_name != 'Gmail'
)
SELECT 'Dependent Applications' as analysis_type, app_name as result
FROM dependent_apps
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Alternative Applications' as analysis_type, app_name as result
FROM alternatives;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
// Find impact of removing Gmail
MATCH (gmail:ExternalApp {name: 'Gmail'})
OPTIONAL MATCH (gmail)<-[:DEPENDS_ON]-(dependent:Application)
OPTIONAL MATCH (gmail)<-[:INTEGRATES_WITH]-(integrated:Application)
OPTIONAL MATCH (gmail)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(category:Category)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(alternative:Application)
RETURN 
    collect(DISTINCT dependent.name) as dependent_apps,
    collect(DISTINCT integrated.name) as integrated_apps,
    collect(DISTINCT alternative.name) as alternative_apps
```

**Analysis:** The graph approach provides a more comprehensive impact analysis in a single query, while SQL requires multiple complex queries or unions.

## Scenario 6: Finding Circular Dependencies

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
-- Extremely complex recursive CTE required
WITH RECURSIVE dependency_paths AS (
    SELECT app_name as start_app, 
           TRIM(dep.value) as current_app,
           app_name + ' -> ' + TRIM(dep.value) as path,
           1 as depth
    FROM applications
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(depends_on_apps, ',') dep
    WHERE depends_on_apps IS NOT NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT dp.start_app,
           TRIM(dep2.value) as current_app,
           dp.path + ' -> ' + TRIM(dep2.value),
           dp.depth + 1
    FROM dependency_paths dp
    JOIN applications a ON dp.current_app = a.app_name
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(a.depends_on_apps, ',') dep2
    WHERE dp.depth < 10 
      AND a.depends_on_apps IS NOT NULL
      AND dp.path NOT LIKE '%' + TRIM(dep2.value) + '%'
)
SELECT start_app, current_app, path
FROM dependency_paths
WHERE start_app = current_app AND depth > 1;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
MATCH (a:Application)-[:DEPENDS_ON*1..10]->(a)
RETURN a.name as app_with_circular_dependency
```

**Analysis:** Finding circular dependencies is trivial in a graph database but extremely complex in SQL.

## Scenario 7: Recommendation Engine - Find Similar Applications

### Relational Approach (SQL)
```sql
-- Complex similarity calculation
WITH app_features AS (
    SELECT app_name,
           category,
           vendor_name,
           deployment_type,
           platform,
           CASE WHEN annual_cost < 10000 THEN 'Low'
                WHEN annual_cost < 50000 THEN 'Medium'
                ELSE 'High' END as cost_tier
    FROM applications
),
similarity_scores AS (
    SELECT a1.app_name as app1,
           a2.app_name as app2,
           (CASE WHEN a1.category = a2.category THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
            CASE WHEN a1.vendor_name = a2.vendor_name THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
            CASE WHEN a1.deployment_type = a2.deployment_type THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
            CASE WHEN a1.platform = a2.platform THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +
            CASE WHEN a1.cost_tier = a2.cost_tier THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as similarity_score
    FROM app_features a1
    CROSS JOIN app_features a2
    WHERE a1.app_name != a2.app_name
)
SELECT app1, app2, similarity_score
FROM similarity_scores
WHERE similarity_score >= 3
ORDER BY similarity_score DESC;
```

### Graph Approach (Cypher)
```cypher
MATCH (a1:Application)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(c:Category)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(a2:Application)
MATCH (a1)-[:SUPPLIED_BY]->(v:Vendor)<-[:SUPPLIED_BY]-(a2)
WHERE a1 <> a2
OPTIONAL MATCH (a1)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(e:ExternalApp)<-[:DEPENDS_ON]-(a2)
RETURN a1.name as app1, a2.name as app2,
       count(DISTINCT c) + count(DISTINCT v) + count(DISTINCT e) as similarity_score
ORDER BY similarity_score DESC
```

**Analysis:** The graph approach naturally captures relationships for similarity calculations, while SQL requires complex scoring logic.

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Relational Databases When:
- Data is primarily tabular
- Transactions and ACID compliance are critical
- Reporting and aggregation are primary use cases
- Relationships are simple and well-defined

### Use Graph Databases When:
- Relationships are as important as entities
- Need to traverse multiple levels of connections
- Pattern matching and path finding are required
- Recommendation engines and social networks
- Impact analysis and dependency mapping

## Conclusion

While both relational and graph databases have their place, graph databases excel when dealing with highly connected data. The examples above demonstrate that what requires complex SQL with multiple joins, recursive CTEs, and string parsing becomes simple, readable Cypher queries in a graph database.

For application portfolio management, where understanding dependencies, integrations, and relationships is crucial, graph databases provide a more natural and powerful approach to data analysis.
